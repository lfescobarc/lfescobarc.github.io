<div class="text-justify" markdown="1">
I am a Mechatronics Engineer and a Ph.D. candidate in Robotics at West Virginia University, with over a decade of experience bridging the gap between industrial automation and academic research.

Currently, my work focuses on autonomous navigation for GNSS-denied environments. I design and fabricate custom multirotor UAVs and formulate energy-aware coverage path planning algorithms for complex, subterranean inspections. My daily technical stack heavily involves ROS 2, multi-robot coordination, and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a Professor and Head of the Robotics Laboratory at Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE in Ecuador, where I led the implementation of the university's Mechatronics Engineering program. I also bring hands-on industry experience in continuous improvement and industrial automation, having deployed robotic systems and optimized workflows for engineering teams.

I am actively seeking postdoctoral research opportunities starting in May 2026. Feel free to download my CV, view my latest publications, or contact me using the links in the header.
